# Resistor Networks Solution

## What is this?
This repository contains my solution to the Resistor Networks Solution for section C of Mentor application.

## What is included?
* resistor_networks.py - The driver code for the program solution.
* test_suite.py - The test application with test cases consisting of the examples provided in the [original problem](https://edabit.com/challenge/eWXL8Jz78hP5tW644).
* Space Complexity Report - A brief breakdown of the space complexity of the solution in respects to Big O notation.

## How to run?
This solution is solved using Python 3.10.7+.
With Python installed on your PC, once you have copied the folder containing the script to your local directory, you can run the file using your terminal or command line from any platform(Mac OS, Windows, Linux), by navigating to the directory containing the script, and running the following command:
```console
> python resistor_networks.py
```

You can also run the test_suite by navigating to the local directory and running the command:
```console
> python test_suite.py
```
