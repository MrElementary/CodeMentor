Space Complexity Report:

The Space Complexity of this function can be expressed as O(n), where n is the total number of resistance values in our data set.

The reason for this is that the program utilizes the function in such a manner that the input data set and any intermediate returned results are stored in
memory throughout each recursive call of the function.

The worst-case scenario would be incrementally related to the size of the data set itself, as the larger the data set, 
the longer the overall processing time will be due to the larger number of recursive calls required for each tuple/list to unpack. 
This continous increment of recursion would ultimately require large increases in memory to support the successful run of the application.
