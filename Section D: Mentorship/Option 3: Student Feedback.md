As part of any customer related environment, critique and concerns are commonplace and there will always be irate situations to deal with. Having been in a retail environment for over 7 years I have learnt that the most effective method of dealing with these situations is to always create an apologetic environment of understanding, and reach a compromise as effectively as possible.

1. Our main object is to always sedate the situation and remain calm while doing so. As mentors our main focus should always be to bring understanding, compassion and a solution to the table for our customers and our students.

2. Review the students feedback, identify the issues raised on their side and locate where mishaps or miscommunication between you and the student may have occurred.

3. Depending on the severity of the critique, I can either as a mentor reach out to the student and find an amicable resolution that would benefit them best, or perhaps escalate the situation to a more senior personnel member.

4. Assuming we are however able to interact with the student post-feedback, we always focus on listening to their concerns. Provide constructive feedback, be apologetic and let the student know that we value the feedback good or bad and that as fellow human beings we are also at times prone to fault, and while this may be the case we will continue to strive toward a better learning experience for any student we interact with.

5. Once we have resolved the issue and de-escelated the situation we can try to identify resources and additional support that may be required, make sure our student understands that we have nothing but their best interest at heart and will continue to improve as mentors.

7. Ultimately while we cannot dictate to our customer to remove a negative review directly, we should strive to leave a positive impression after reaching a resolve so that the student might feel implored to reverse their decision.

8. Conclusively if for any reason no amicable resolution is reached and the student continues to feel unresponsive to our improvement we will always remain professional and resolve the situation to a higher authority.
